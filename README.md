# string_function
I have implemented my own string functions. Just as a learning practise.

Description of the files that are uploaded
1) my_lib.h
This header file contains all the function declaration of all the functions that are implemented
2) my_lib.c
This file contains all the function definition of all the files

in order to execute the above code. use the following lines
to compile the code:
gcc -o aout my_lib.c main.c
to get the output
./aout
